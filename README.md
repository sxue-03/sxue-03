Welcome to my Cybersecurity Portfolio Project! This repository is part of my ongoing journey to deepen my knowledge and skills in cybersecurity. Here, I explore various concepts and tools through hands-on projects—ranging from network security and intrusion detection to vulnerability assessments and incident response.

My goal is to showcase practical implementations and document what I’ve learned along the way. I hope this not only demonstrates my technical abilities but also serves as a resource for others interested in cybersecurity.


## Objective


My journey in information technology systems has sparked a strong passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this dynamic field. I am specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Security Analyst, where I can apply my technical skills, continue learning, and contribute to protecting critical systems from evolving cyber threats.
