Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Portfolio** — hands-on labs and artifacts that document how I'm learning and applying SOC, detection engineering, automation, and security governance.

---

## 🎯 Objective
I am preparing for a role in a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** as a **Tier 1 Security Analyst**. This repository shows practical labs and scripts that demonstrate my current skills and learning path.

## 🧠 Skills & Tools (honest & evidence-linked)

> Items marked **(evidence)** link to a project folder or file that shows the work.

### Core / Proficient
- **Python** — *Proficient* — wrote `log-analyzer/analyzer.py` to parse auth logs and generate alerts. (see `log-analyzer/`)  
- **Bash** — *Familiar* — used for VM setup scripts and automation in lab notes. (see `soc-lab/setup/`)  
- **SIEM (Wazuh / Elastic)** — *Working knowledge* — deployed Wazuh All-in-One and ingested host logs. (see `soc-lab/`)

### Detection & Response
- **Log analysis** — *Proficient* — parsing, aggregation, simple alerting (see `log-analyzer/`).  
- **Incident Response (IR)** — *Familiar* — IR playbooks and an example incident report in `soc-lab/incident-playbooks/`.  
- **Penetration testing (lab)** — *Familiar* — local recon and exploit writeups against Metasploitable / DVWA (see `pentest-lab/findings/`).

### Policy & Governance
- **Security Policy Writing** — *Working knowledge* — NIST-aligned policy drafts in `policies/` (IR, Logging, Vulnerability Mgmt).  
- **Risk Assessment** — *Familiar* — basic asset & threat scoring with mitigation plans (see `policies/risk-assessment.md`).

### Scripting / Automation
- **Automation with Python** — *Proficient* — scheduled log parsing, CSV/alert export (see `log-analyzer/`).  
- **Small tooling** — *Familiar* — helper scripts for lab setup and result parsing (see `scripts/`).

---

## 🧰 Tools (what I currently use)
- **SIEM / Logging:** Wazuh, Elastic (ELK) — working knowledge.  
- **Pentest / Recon:** nmap, Metasploit (lab use) — familiar.  
- **Forensics / Sysadmin:** Procmon export, Windows Event log exports — familiar.  
- **Development:** Python, Bash — used for automation and parsing.

---

## ⚠️ Network & Endpoint
> These two areas are intentionally left blank for now — I will update with concrete items and evidence as I build and document labs.

- **Network:** *(to be added — learning path & evidence pending)*  
- **Endpoint:** *(to be added — learning path & evidence pending)*

## 📁 Projects (high level)
- `soc-lab/` — SIEM setup, detection rules, IR playbooks, sample alerts.  
- `log-analyzer/` — Python analyzer to detect brute-force and produce alerts.  
- `pentest-lab/` — Local pentest targets (Metasploitable, DVWA) with findings.  
- `policies/` — NIST-aligned policy pack and risk assessment workbook.  
- `scripts/` — helper scripts and small automation utilities.

---

## ✅ How I show evidence
For each claimed skill I include:
- A short README inside the project folder describing the lab steps and commands.  
- Artifacts: screenshots, exported logs, `nmap` outputs, CSVs, and PDF reports.  
- A dated learning log entry (see `docs/learning-log.md`) summarizing experiments and results.

---

## 📚 Current study plan (next steps)
- Add Network mini-labs: Wireshark pcap walkthrough, `nmap` reconnaissance report, Suricata alert example.  
- Add Endpoint mini-labs: Procmon trace, PowerShell event export, Velociraptor quick hunt.  
- For each mini-lab I’ll commit screenshots, raw outputs, and a 1-page summary so I can update the Network & Endpoint sections with evidence.
